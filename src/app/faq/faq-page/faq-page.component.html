    <mat-card-title>Why can I only run Backtesting on a relatively recent time period?
    </mat-card-title>
  </mat-card-header>
  <mat-card-content>
    <p>To unleash its prowess, Chartologist must undergo training on historical data distinct from the backtesting period.<br>
      This precaution is essential as the backtesting period serves to assess the algorithm's performance.
      Employing identical datasets for both training and testing would yield an overly optimistic appraisal of the algorithm's efficacy.</p>
    <p>Consequently, the training period concludes prior to the commencement of the backtesting period, with the latter being adjusted each time the algorithm undergoes retraining.

    <mat-card-title>How reliable Chartologist is? Can I trust it with my money?
    </mat-card-title>
  </mat-card-header>
  <mat-card-content>
    <p>
      Chartologist is simply a tool designed to aid your decision-making processâ€”it's not a magic bullet.
      Think of it as a moving average indicator on steroids.
      While incredibly valuable, trading decisions should never hinge solely on its output.
      It's prudent to supplement its insights with other indicators.
      Additionally, the market is subject to external influences like news, politics, and unforeseen events, which may not be reflected in the charts.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, past patterns don't guarantee future outcomes, and trends can abruptly shift.
      While Chartologist's algorithms are regularly updated, their predictive efficacy beyond the backtesting period cannot be guaranteed.
